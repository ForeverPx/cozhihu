          The 0.3.9 release of cozhihu is the first release version of the cozhihu project. At the core, it is a full
          rewrite that addresses many of the extensibility and usability problems
          that could not be addressed in previous versions.
        </p>

        <p>
          This release contains many breaking changes, but easy-upgrade paths have
          been created as well as helper modules that will allow for backwards
          compatibility to be maintained with past versions of cozhihu. Upgrading
          <em>will</em> require you to read the release notes carefully, but the
          migration path should be relatively straightforward. You can view a list
          of the most common changes that you will need to make
          <a href="https://github.com/icai/cozhihu/releases">in the release notes</a>.

          Below is an in-depth review of what is new in cozhihu, as well as some of
          the major changes that have been made.
